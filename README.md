# Predicting Impact of Climate Change on Marine Biodiversity üåäüê†

## Overview
This project aims to predict how climate change (such as ocean temperature rise, acidification, and deoxygenation) affects marine biodiversity. Using environmental datasets and marine species data, we build predictive models to understand potential risks and identify vulnerable regions and species.

We have:
- Built predictive models using **Random Forest** for **feature selection**.
- Implemented **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for **long-term trend forecasting**.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand climate and biodiversity data.
- Preprocess and engineer relevant features.
- Use Random Forest to select important features influencing biodiversity.
- Build LSTM models to predict biodiversity trends over time.
- Evaluate model accuracy and robustness.
- Visualize the key findings and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset
- Sources:
  - NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
  - GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
  - OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System)
  - IPCC reports
- Example data attributes:
  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
  - pH Levels
  - Salinity
  - Marine Species Richness and Abundance

## Project Structure
-  Raw and processed datasets.
- Google Colab notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, feature selection, modeling, and evaluation.
- Reusable Python scripts (optional).
- Visualizations and generated reports.
